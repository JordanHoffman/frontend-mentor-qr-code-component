## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties & variables
- BEM naming conventions
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Just a reminder in boilerplates to always set box sizing to border-box and remember that base elements like body have preset padding and possibly borders that you might want to remove.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development

Continue exploring best ways to use BEM.

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) - BEM naming conventions for css to reign in the chaos.
